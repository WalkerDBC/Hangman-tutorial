# Step-by-Step build process for this section

### Starting from the base of [Previous build:`to 0702`](#)

## Our Goal
The object of this step is create an array of Tile objects connected to the 3 Tile elements in our html file.

## Why this matters
By creating these objects, we will be able to manipulate their behavior and appearance base on rules or interaction with the js code

## What you'll need to know

JavaScript

- [Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

- [JS HTML DOM style methods](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_css.asp)


## Cleaning up..
From our last file, we created a few objects simply intended to test our scripts in the browser (the "TEST" button).  Now let's clean these files up a bit by putting all of the 'test' stuff in the `test.js` file.  This will leave us with a cleaner code file for working on the displays.

### In your `display.js` folder:

#### 0x. Move the `alert()` test function and `testTile` var to the `test.js` file, placing them just after the `testButton` variable on line 6
