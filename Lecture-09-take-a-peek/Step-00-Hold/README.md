# Brute Force Files

So, this is the 'brute force' version of the code.  Simple artchitecture:  Just vanilla js, html, and css (with a little Bootstrap)

This gets us to a function game with some bugs and limitations (some more obvious than others).

Enjoy the codebase and feel free to make a Pull request to improve the code!
