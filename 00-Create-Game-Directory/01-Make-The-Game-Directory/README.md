# Step 01: Making the Game directory

## Previous build

## What we are doing
We are going to create the basic files required for a simple front-end game in four (4) simple steps:

1. Create a game folder
2. Make basic HTMl, CSS, and JS files
3. Add some simple code
4. Connect the files to each other

## Time estimate:  30 minutes

## Tools needed
- Sublime or other basic text editor
- Internet browser (e.g Chrome)

# Start building!

1. Create a game folder
- make folder called `Hangman-Game`
	- this is where we will hold the primary game files


2. Make basic HTMl, CSS, and JS files
- `index.html`
	- this is the home page for the game
- `main.css`
	- this is the file used to create the look of the page
- `main.js`
	- this is the file used for the game logic and behavior

3. Add some simple code
`//index.html`
