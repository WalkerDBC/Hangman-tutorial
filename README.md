# Hangman-tutorial
Series of code files for building a very simple browser version of hangman using Vanilla JS, CSS and HTML (with a sprinkling of Bootstrap)

Each folder represents an incremental version of the game we're building.  Within each folder is a `pseudocode.md` file.  This file will provide a general map of the steps taken to build this particular stage of the code.

## Using the files
Stry to build the next stage on your own and then use the code here to compare your code
