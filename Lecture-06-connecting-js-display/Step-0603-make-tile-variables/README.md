# Step-by-Step build process for this section

### Starting from the base of: [Previous build:`Step-0602-activate-a-test-button`](https://github.com/NeuTrix/Hangman-tutorial/tree/master/Lecture-06-connecting-js-display/Step-0602-activate-a-test-button)

## Our Goal
The object of this step is to capture the tile elements in our js file as variables in an array. From there, we'll want to manipulate their 'state' in the browser (e.g. Change their color or visibility) 

## Why this matters
By making this connection, we'll be able to see how to tie specific
elements from the user facing web page to actions and logic in our
.js file. 


## What you'll need to know

#### Javascript
	- creating variables
	- creating, traversing, and mutating *arrays*
	- #document.getElementById()
	- 
#### HTML
#### CSS


# Startbuilding!
## Cleaning up
In the last section, we made a base.js file with some test code in it
Now we need to rename that file for clarity before we start this build.

## Grabbing the "tile" variables

Now that we have more js code coming, we are going to change our file
structure a bit

### In your file folder
#### 0x. Create a new *folder* called `game-javascript`
#### 0x. Change the name of the `base.js` file to `test.js`
#### 0x. Create a new file called `tiles.js`
### In your HTML file
#### 0x.
#### 0x.
#### 0x.
#### 0x.



#### 0x. Make sure each of the tile elements has a unique id
They should look something like this
```hmtl
<td class="outline table-tile" id="tile-03">
	<h3>tile 3</h3>
</td>
```

### Creating a new js file

- This is a new file that we'll use for our new js code
- In your HTML file, commeent out the 

#### 0x. Create tile variables
